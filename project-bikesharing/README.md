Project Bikesharing

Build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! 
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

#Files
	- hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. Records: 17379 hours
	- day.csv - bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. Records: 731 days
	- Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb - for running the model and making predictions
	- my_answers.py - provides helper functions, called and executed in Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb

#How to use
       - Place hour.csv and day.csv in a folder called Bike-Sharing-Dataset
       - Execute Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb; Make sure to run all the cells
