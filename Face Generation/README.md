You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks.

### Files

  - dlnd_face_generation.ipynb : for running the model and making predictions 
  - problem_unittests.py : provides helper functions, called in dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
  - dlnd_face_generation.html : final report of the working model with all cells having been run and tested
  
### How to use
  - Execute dlnd_face_generation.ipynb.ipynb; Make sure to run all the cells
